### Maturity Analysis of `src/crypto.ts`

This code is an excellent example of a successful **"Green" phase** in a TDD cycle. It is well-structured, uses the correct modern APIs (`crypto.subtle`), and is written specifically to make the test suite pass. However, its maturity level is best described as **Demo Ready**, but **not Production Ready**.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

---

#### 1. Just Passing Tests: (Excellent)
The code perfectly fulfills its primary goal: to satisfy the specification laid out in `crypto.test.ts`. Every function directly implements the logic required to pass the round-trip and failure-case tests.

---

#### 2. Demo Ready: (Good)
The implementation is solid enough for any functional demonstration. It correctly performs the end-to-end flow of key generation, encryption, decryption, signing, and verification. If you were building a proof-of-concept to show these features working, this code would be perfectly suitable.

#### 3. Production Ready: (Needs Improvement)
The code contains several issues that make it unsuitable for a production environment where security and robustness are critical.

* **Critical Security Flaw (Static IV):**
    * The `aesAlgorithm` uses a hardcoded, zero-filled Initialization Vector (`iv: new Uint8Array(12)`). In AES-GCM mode, the IV **must be unique for every single encryption operation** performed with the same key.
    * Reusing an IV is catastrophic; it allows an attacker to break the encryption and recover the plaintext. This is the single most critical issue preventing this code from being production-ready.
    * **Fix:** A random IV should be generated for each encryption, prepended to the ciphertext, and then read back during decryption.

* **Security Best Practice (Key Usage):**
    * The `generateKeys` method creates an RSA key pair with usages limited to `['encrypt', 'decrypt']`. The `sign` and `verify` methods cleverly work around this by exporting and re-importing the keys with `['sign']` or `['verify']` usage.
    * While this passes the tests, cryptographic best practice is to maintain **key separation**: one key pair should be used for encryption/decryption, and a *separate* key pair should be used for signing/verification. This limits the impact if one key is ever compromised.

* **Robustness (Error Handling):**
    * The methods lack any internal `try...catch` blocks. If any `crypto.subtle` operation fails (e.g., due to malformed ciphertext, an invalid key, or algorithm mismatch), it will throw an unhandled exception that the calling code would have to manage entirely. Production code would typically include more robust error handling to wrap these low-level errors into more specific application errors.

* **Data Format Brittleness:**
    * The `encrypt` method combines the encrypted AES key and the ciphertext by simple concatenation. The `decrypt` method splits them by assuming the encrypted key is a fixed size (`ciphertext.slice(0, 256)`). This works only because the RSA key size is fixed at 2048 bits. If the key size were to change, this code would break silently and mysteriously.
    * **Fix:** A more robust approach would be to use a simple structured format, like prepending a length value (e.g., `[2 bytes for key length][encrypted key][ciphertext]`) or using a JSON object with base64-encoded strings for each part.

In summary, the TDD process has successfully produced a functionally correct piece of code. The next step in a professional workflow would be a **"Refactor" phase** to address the security and robustness issues identified above before it could be considered production-ready.
